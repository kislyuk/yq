yq: Command-line YAML/XML processor - jq wrapper for YAML and XML documents
===========================================================================

Installation
------------
::

    pip install yq

Before using ``yq``, you also have to install its dependency, ``jq``. See the `jq installation instructions
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>`_ for details and directions specific to your platform.

On macOS, ``yq`` is also available on `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_: use ``brew install python-yq``.

Synopsis
--------

``yq`` takes YAML input, converts it to JSON, and pipes it to `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_::

    < input.yml yq .foo.bar

Like in ``jq``, you can also specify input filename(s) as arguments::

    yq .foo.bar input.yml

By default, no conversion of ``jq`` output is done. Use the ``--yaml-output``/``-y`` argument to convert it back into YAML::

    < input.yml yq -y .foo.bar

Use the ``--width``/``-w`` argument to pass the line wrap width for string literals. All other command line arguments are
forwarded to ``jq``. ``yq`` forwards the exit code ``jq`` produced, unless there was an error in YAML parsing, in which case
the exit code is 1. See the `jq manual <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_ for more details on ``jq`` features and
options.

YAML `tags <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2764295>`_ in the input are ignored (any nested data is treated as
untagged). Key order is preserved.

XML support
-----------
``yq`` also supports XML. The ``yq`` package installs an executable, ``xq``, which
`transcodes XML to JSON <https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/05/31/converting-between-xml-and-json.html>`_ using
`xmltodict <https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict>`_ and pipes it to ``jq``. Roundtrip transcoding is available with
the ``xq --xml-output``/``xq -x`` option. Multiple XML documents can be passed in separate files/streams as
``xq a.xml b.xml``. Entity expansion and DTD resolution is disabled to avoid XML parsing vulnerabilities.
